        In many American families, it is common for both parents to have full-time jobs, even when they have little children. But if both Mom and Dad are gone all day, who on earth takes care of the kids? In quite a few homes, the nanny does.

        A long time ago, only rich people could afford to have a nanny. Nannies were usually middle-aged, unmarried women who were strict with the children. They insisted on their children's behaving themselves at all times.

        These days, however, many middle-class families have college students to work as nannies. Usually these people who take care of children are young women, but some young men do this type of work, too. Often nannies live with the family, and the children grow up to love them very much. These live-in jobs appeal to college students because they don't have to spend money on rent or food.

        Sometimes foreign students take jobs as nannies, hoping such work will help them improve their English skills. There is one problem, though. Because they spend so much time playing and talking with little children, most of the English they learn is "baby talk!"
